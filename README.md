# jklm-trainer
A training bot for the JKLM word game.

## Dependencies
* Selenium for dynamic web scraping
* Chrome webdriver

## Features
* Customise the name and priority setting of the bot.
* 4 different word priority settings are given: Alphabetical order, word length (longest), word length (shortest), and optimal alphabet use.
* Ability to keep track of letters used so letters can be used optimally for maximum difficulty.
* Ability to keep track of words already guessed by the bot.
* Run multiple bots through the webdriver.
* Get commandline feedback of when new lives were gained by the bot.


### Further ideas to consider.
* Adjustable bot difficulty.
* 'Silent' webdriver (try to reduce CPU usage and clutter).
